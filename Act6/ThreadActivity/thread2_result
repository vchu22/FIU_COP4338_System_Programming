// Result
Shared variable: 100
Thread ID: 0
Thread ID: 1
Thread ID: 2
Thread ID: 4
Thread ID: 3
Shared variable: 110

// Observation
The result is very similar to that of the first program. The order of the IDs is still
inconsistent each time it runs. The only difference it makes is that mutex prevents
two threads from simultaneously modifying the same variables which can result in
inconsistent values.

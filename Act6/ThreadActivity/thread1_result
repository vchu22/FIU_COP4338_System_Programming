// Result
Shared variable: 100
Thread ID: 0
Thread ID: 1
Thread ID: 3
Thread ID: 4
Thread ID: 2
Shared variable: 110

// Observation
After running the program multiple times, I found that the shared variable value
was quite consistent each time I ran. However, the orders of the thread IDs are
not always consistent. Sometimes, the larger numbers may go before the smaller
numbers.
